## IPv6 advanced functionalities

### IPv6 addresses

#### Hierarchy

- structure defined to simplify routing
- composition
    - global routing prefix (48 bits)
        - first 16 bits (e.g. 2001)
        - next 16 bits assigned by Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
        - next 16 bits assigned by Local Internet Registry (LIR)
    - subnet identifier (16 bits)
    - interface identifier (64 bits)

#### Abbreviation

- leading zeros omission
    - zeros at the beginning of a block can be omitted (e.g., 0074 -> 74)
- double colon compression
    - consecutive groups of zeros replaced by `::`
    - can only be used once in an address

#### Address types

- unicast
    - identifies a single network interface
- multicast
    - identifies a group of interfaces
    - data delivered to all group members
    - prefix `ff00::/8`
    - replaces broadcast (broadcast not used in IPv6)
- anycast
    - identifies a group of interfaces
    - data delivered to the nearest member (topologically)

### Path MTU discovery

- fragmentation policy
    - routers are not allowed to fragment packets
    - fragmentation performed only by source nodes
- discovery mechanism
    - source sends packet with local link MTU size
    - if packet is too big for a router, it drops it and sends ICMPv6 Packet Too Big message
    - source reduces packet size and retries
    - prevents fragmentation overhead in the network

### Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

#### Overview

- protocol replacing IPv4 ARP, RARP, and ICMP Router Discovery
- implemented over ICMPv6
- key messages
    - router solicitation (RS, type 133)
    - router advertisement (RA, type 134)
    - neighbor solicitation (NS, type 135)
    - neighbor advertisement (NA, type 136)
    - redirect (type 137)

#### Address resolution (L2)

- replaces ARP
- mechanism
    - node sends NS to solicited-node multicast address of target
    - message contains target IPv6 address and sender's L2 address
    - target replies with NA containing its L2 address
    - solicited-node multicast ensures efficiency (no broadcast)

#### Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

- checks if address is already in use
- process
    - node sends NS with its own tentative address as target
    - source address set to `::` (unspecified)
    - if NA received, address is duplicate
    - performed during autoconfiguration

#### Neighbor Unreachability Detection (NUD)

- verifies if neighbor is still reachable
- states
    - incomplete (resolution in progress)
    - reachable (recently confirmed)
    - stale (timeout elapsed, reachability unknown)
    - delay (packet sent, waiting for upper layer confirmation)
    - probe (actively verifying reachability with NS)

#### Autoconfiguration

- stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)
    - device generates address using link-local prefix and interface ID (MAC or random)
    - DAD performed to ensure uniqueness
    - RS sent to find routers
    - RA received containing network prefixes
    - global address formed by combining prefix and interface ID
- stateful autoconfiguration
    - uses DHCPv6
    - indicated by flags in RA message (Managed flag)

### IPv6 mobility support

#### Concepts

- enables nodes to move between networks while maintaining connectivity
- home address
    - permanent global address in home network
- care-of address (CoA)
    - temporary address in foreign network
- home agent (HA)
    - router in home network forwarding packets to mobile node
- correspondent node (CN)
    - peer communicating with mobile node

#### Operation modes

- bidirectional tunneling
    - packets tunnelled through HA
    - reliable but suboptimal routing (triangle routing)
- route optimization
    - direct communication between MN and CN
    - requires binding registration with CN
    - secured by Return Routability Procedure

#### Return Routability Procedure

- verifies MN is reachable at both home address and CoA
- prevents redirection attacks
- message exchange
    - Home Test Init (HoTI) via HA
    - Care-of Test Init (CoTI) direct to CN
    - CN replies with Home Test (HoT) and Care-of Test (CoT)
    - session key generated for binding update

### IPv6 security

#### IPsec

- mandatory/recommended part of IPv6 stack
- framework for securing IP communications
- components
    - authentication header (AH)
        - provides integrity and authentication
        - protects IP header and payload (except mutable fields)
        - does not provide confidentiality (no encryption)
    - encapsulating security payload (ESP)
        - provides confidentiality (encryption), integrity, and authentication
        - protects payload (and IP header in tunnel mode)
- modes
    - transport mode (protects payload only)
    - tunnel mode (protects entire IP packet, used for VPNs)

#### Key management

- security association (SA)
    - simplex agreement between peers
    - identified by SPI, destination IP, and protocol
- IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange)
    - automated key negotiation protocol
    - establishes SAs
    - authenticates peers

### IPv6 QoS support

#### Mechanisms

- integrated services (IntServ)
    - flow-based resource reservation (RSVP)
    - guarantees bandwidth and delay
    - requires state in all routers (scalability issues)
- differentiated services (DiffServ)
    - packet marking based on priority
    - stateless core network
    - traffic class field used for DSCP (DiffServ Code Point)
- flow label
    - 20-bit field in IPv6 header
    - identifies packets of the same flow for special handling
    - enables efficient flow classification without deep packet inspection

### IPv6 transition

#### Dual stack

- devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks simultaneously
- most flexible and common approach during transition
- applications choose protocol based on DNS (A vs AAAA record)

#### Tunneling

- encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets
- connects IPv6 islands over IPv4 infrastructure
- protocols
    - 6to4 (automatic tunneling using specific prefix)
    - Teredo (NAT traversal support)
    - ISATAP (intra-site tunneling)

#### Translation

- NAT-PT (Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation)
- translates headers between IPv4 and IPv6
- allows IPv6-only nodes to talk to IPv4-only nodes
- generally discouraged due to complexity and loss of end-to-end features
